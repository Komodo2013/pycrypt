This is a group of tests to be able to tell how 'random' something is...
obviously you can't tell for certain, but here are my attempts

each test will read in an n*n bitmap and will perform tests on that image

Tests included:
visual test of bitmaps
Frequency Test: Monobit
Frequency Test: Block
Runs Test
Test for the Longest Runs of Ones in a Block
Binary Matrix Rank Test
Discrete Fourier Transform (Spectral Test)
Maurer's Universal Statistical Test

Tests that I'll include:
Linear Complexity Test
Serial Test
Approximate Entropy Test
Cumulative Sums Test
Random Excursions Test
Random Excursions Variant Test

Tests not included:
# Both of these tests require templates... I'm not interested in specific patterns and don't know where to get
# templates yet... I'll just ignore these for now
Non-Overlapping Template Matching Test
Overlapping Template Matching Test
