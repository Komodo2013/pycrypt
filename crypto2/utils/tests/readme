This is a group of tests to be able to tell how 'random' something is...
obviously you can't tell for certain, but here are my attempts

each test will read in an n*n bitmap and will perform tests on that image

Tests included:
visual test of bitmaps
Frequency Test: Monobit
Frequency Test: Block
Runs Test
Test for the Longest Runs of Ones in a Block

Tests that I'll include:
Binary Matrix Rank Test
Discrete Fourier Transform (Spectral Test)
Non-Overlapping Template Matching Test
Overlapping Template Matching Test
Maurer's Universal Statistical Test
Linear Complexity Test
Serial Test
Approximate Entropy Test
Cumulative Sums Test
Random Excursions Test
Random Excursions Variant Test
